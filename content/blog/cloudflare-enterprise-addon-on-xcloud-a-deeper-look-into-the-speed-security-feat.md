Cloudflare Enterprise Addon on xCloud: A Deeper Look Into the Speed & Security Features

Website performance and security have always been xCloud's top priorities, along with a commitment to give flexibility and value to agencies, developers, and businesses through a simpler managed hosting experience.

And it works! From the team behind WPDeveloper, trusted by millions of WordPress users worldwide, xCloud has grown into a platform where users manage everything from single sites to entire client portfolios, with one of the most active hosting communities on Facebook shaping every release.

This month, we introduced the Cloudflare Enterprise addon through our direct partnership with Cloudflare, bringing enterprise-tier speed and security to any xCloud domain, all within the xCloud platform. Unsurprisingly, the launch generated plenty of curiosity about what exactly is included, from the intelligent firewall to full-page caching at the edge.

To answer the questions our users have asked since launch, here's a deep dive into those features and their benefits.

What Is Cloudflare Enterprise?

It's hard not to have heard of Cloudflare these days. It's the DDoS mitigation and Content Delivery Network (CDN) service sitting in front of roughly a quarter of all websites, with a network spanning 330+ cities across more than 100 countries and, as of 2026, over 500 Tbps of network capacity.

Cloudflare also offers the Cloudflare Enterprise tier — its top level of service, with prioritized routing, enterprise-grade managed security rulesets, and guaranteed enterprise-level performance and support. Traditionally, this tier is sold through negotiated annual contracts, which has kept it out of reach for most website owners.

Since this is the level of value we wanted for all of our xCloud users, we partnered directly with Cloudflare and built an addon powered by Cloudflare Enterprise, provisioned through xCloud-managed Cloudflare for SaaS. All the advanced configuration is taken care of by us in the backend — users simply activate the addon for a domain to get enterprise-level performance and security.

Here's what that provisioning model means in practice. Cloudflare for SaaS allows a platform like xCloud to hold the enterprise relationship with Cloudflare and add individual customer domains to it as custom hostnames. Your domain rides on our Enterprise configuration — with all the caching behavior, security rulesets, and certificate management already tuned — while you never create a Cloudflare account, never move a nameserver, and never touch a page rule.

That distinction matters more than it sounds. A traditional Cloudflare setup means owning a second dashboard, learning its concepts, and getting the configuration right yourself — and configuration mistakes on an edge network are visible to your visitors immediately. With the addon, the correct configuration is the starting point, not something you have to build toward.

What Makes Cloudflare Enterprise Crucial for Performance?

Today's visitors expect websites that load instantly and never go offline. Recognizing this, Google uses page experience and speed signals as ranking factors for search.

The physics matter here. Cloudflare notes that every 100 miles of geographic distance between a website and its visitor adds measurable latency — so when someone visits an unoptimized site, their request travels all the way to the origin server, wherever in the world that happens to be.

TLDR: The longer the distance, the slower your website loads.

And the stakes are well documented:

Google found that site latency as small as 100–400 milliseconds has a measurable impact on user behavior.  
Industry studies have repeatedly linked each additional second of load time to significant drops in conversions.  
Roughly half of mobile users expect pages to respond in 2 seconds or less.

When traffic spikes hit, the problem compounds: too many simultaneous requests overload the server, and the impact ranges from a few seconds of delay to the entire site becoming unavailable — usually at the worst possible moment.

How Does the Cloudflare Network Work?

The Cloudflare network acts as a proxy between your visitors and your server. Visitors no longer communicate directly with your origin — they communicate with the Cloudflare network, which sits in front of it.

Cloudflare's data centers cache your content in the location closest to each visitor. This minimizes latency, reduces the number of requests that ever reach your server, and lets far more visitors access your website at full speed simultaneously. Cloudflare states its network reaches 95% of the world's Internet-connected population within 50 milliseconds.

At the same time, all traffic passing through the network is monitored to proactively block malicious requests, filter out abusive bots, and keep your website safe — before any of it touches your infrastructure.

What Does the Cloudflare Enterprise Addon on xCloud Offer?

Here's what's included on the performance side, on every domain you enable:

Global Enterprise CDN – Your static content — images, CSS, JavaScript — is delivered from whichever of Cloudflare's 330+ data centers is nearest to each visitor, instead of everyone waiting on your origin server. A visitor in Singapore is served from Asia, a visitor in Berlin from Europe, and a visitor in São Paulo from South America — all from the same single site, with no multi-region hosting bill.  
Edge Page Caching – This is where the biggest gains live, and it's worth understanding why. Most "CDN" setups only cache your static files; every actual page request still travels to your origin, waits for PHP and the database to build the page, and travels back. Edge Page Caching changes that: the full HTML page itself is cached and served straight from the edge, so the request never reaches your server at all. That's what produces the dramatic time-to-first-byte improvements — you're removing both the distance and the page-generation time in one move. Your local page caching is bypassed automatically when this is on, so the two layers never conflict — no reconfiguration required, no plugin to remove first.  
Early Hints – The addon sends 103 Early Hints responses so browsers can begin preloading your critical assets — fonts, stylesheets, key scripts — before the final response even arrives. The page doesn't just load faster; it feels faster, because the browser has a head start on rendering by the time the HTML lands.  
One-Click Cache Purge – Ship an update, click Purge from your Overview tab, and your changes go live worldwide immediately.  
SSL Cipher Profiles – Choose Compatible, Modern, or Legacy cipher suites for connections between visitors and the Cloudflare edge — useful for industries with specific encryption requirements.  
Managed Edge SSL – Cloudflare edge certificates are provisioned per domain, with certificate status visible right in your domain table.

What About Automatic Content Optimization?

Web pages today are heavier than ever, and unoptimized static content adds latency — especially on mobile, where the majority of web traffic now originates. The addon handles this automatically:

Image Optimization (Polish-style) – Your images are compressed automatically at the edge, and you choose the mode: Lossy for maximum size reduction, Lossless to preserve every pixel, or Off. Smaller images mean faster downloads and better Core Web Vitals — without an image plugin.

ScrapeShield – Email addresses on your pages are obfuscated automatically, so harvesting bots and spammers come up empty while real visitors see everything normally.

Which Settings Can You Control From Your Panel?

"Fully managed" often means "locked down." We deliberately built this differently: the defaults arrive already optimized — most sites never need to change a thing — but every meaningful control stays visible and adjustable under the Settings tab of your site's Cloudflare Enterprise page. Changes apply to all Cloudflare Enterprise domains on that site, and a single Save Changes click applies them.

The Optimizations section gives you:

Early Hints – toggle browser preloading on or off  
ScrapeShield – toggle email obfuscation  
Caching – toggle static content caching across the global CDN  
Edge Page Caching – toggle full-page caching at the edge  
Image Optimization – choose Lossy, Lossless, or Off  
SSL Cipher – choose Compatible, Modern, or Legacy cipher profiles

The Security section gives you:

Web Application Firewall – toggle the managed WAF rulesets  
Rate Limiting – toggle managed challenges for high-rate IPs  
Browser Integrity Check – toggle suspicious-header filtering  
Under Attack Mode – toggle the last-resort Layer 7 shield  
AI Crawler Blocking – toggle blocking of known AI crawlers

Beyond Settings, the Overview tab holds the one-click Purge Cache action (available as soon as at least one domain is Active), and the Domains tab gives you per-domain management: current status, SSL state, bandwidth usage, a link to your DNS instructions, and Refresh, Retry, and Remove actions on every row.

The philosophy is simple: leave it alone and it works; open it up and it does exactly what you tell it.

Why Do Websites Need Enterprise-Grade Security?

It boils down to three trends:

Attackers are stronger, more automated, and more persistent than ever  
The attack surface keeps growing — more plugins, more APIs, more third-party integrations  
Automated traffic now hits sites of every size, not just big targets

The scale is remarkable. Cloudflare reports blocking around 230 billion cyber threats daily across its network, and mitigated 47.1 million DDoS attacks in 2025 alone — including a record-breaking 31.4 Tbps attack in December 2025. Small websites are not exempt from this environment; they are simply less equipped to absorb it.

The structural problem with the usual answer — security plugins — is that a plugin can only act after malicious traffic has already arrived on your server and started consuming CPU and memory. By the time the request is blocked, you've already paid for it.

How Does the Addon Secure Your Website?

The foundation of the addon's security is Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF), applied by default the moment you activate a domain — with protection running at the network edge, thousands of miles from your origin.

Enterprise WAF with Managed Rulesets – Your domain is protected by Cloudflare's managed rulesets, which are built from observations across the millions of applications behind Cloudflare's platform and updated frequently to cover new vulnerabilities — including zero-day threats, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting. This is the practical difference between a firewall you configure and a firewall that is maintained for you: when a new WordPress plugin vulnerability is disclosed, the ruleset updates at Cloudflare's end, and every protected domain benefits — often before you've even read the security headline. You never write or maintain a rule yourself.

DDoS Protection – Attack floods are absorbed at the edge of Cloudflare's global network — backed by that 500+ Tbps of capacity — instead of ever reaching your server.

Rate Limiting – IP addresses exceeding the managed request threshold receive automatic managed challenges, stopping brute-force attempts and abusive traffic spikes before they egrade performance.

Browser Integrity Check (BIC) – Requests carrying the suspicious or missing HTTP headers most commonly used by spammers and abusive bots are challenged or turned away automatically.

Under Attack Mode – A last-resort Layer 7 shield you can flip on with one toggle: visitors pass additional validation before accessing the site while an active attack is underway.

AI Crawler Blocking – One switch blocks known AI crawlers from scanning and collecting your site's content — no bot lists to build, no rules to maintain. This has become one of the most requested controls of the past two years, and for good reason: AI crawlers now generate a meaningful share of automated traffic across the web, consuming your bandwidth and harvesting your work in the process. If your articles, product data, or images are part of your business, this keeps them yours — and the crawler list is maintained for you as new bots appear.

What Can You See in Analytics and Security Events?

This is the part most users tell us they didn't expect — full visibility, right inside the xCloud panel, with no separate dashboard.

Request Summary – Total requests, with a clear split between traffic served by Cloudflare and traffic served by your origin, plus cache status and top content types, paths, hosts, device types, countries, and edge status codes.

Data Transfer Summary – One toggle switches the same views to bandwidth totals, so you can see exactly how much data the edge carried for you.

Security Events – Every blocked threat is logged, with totals by service and top tables for attacking IP addresses, user agents, paths, countries, hosts, and HTTP methods.

Flexible Time Ranges – Review any window from the last 30 minutes to the last 30 days.

Per-Domain Bandwidth – Usage is shown on every domain row, with a team-wide table listing every protected domain across all your sites.

For agencies, this doubles as ready-made client reporting: requests served from the edge, bandwidth handled, and attacks blocked — the exact numbers that justify the line item on your invoice.

Who Should Enable It First?

Not every site benefits equally from an edge network, so here's an honest guide to where the impact is largest:

WooCommerce and eCommerce stores – Product and category pages are heavy to generate and cache beautifully, while checkout stays dynamic. Add the WAF guarding your payment flows and DDoS protection covering your biggest sales days, and stores typically see the most dramatic combined benefit of any site type.  
Sites with a global audience – If your visitors are spread across continents, distance is almost certainly your largest speed constraint — and it's the one thing no server upgrade can fix. Serving from 330+ locations solves it directly.  
Content and media sites – Heavy pages and large image libraries are exactly what edge caching and automatic image optimization were built for. And if you publish original work, AI Crawler Blocking keeps it from being quietly harvested.  
High-traffic and campaign-driven sites – When launches or seasonal peaks strain your server, moving the bulk of requests to the edge changes what your existing hosting plan can absorb — often postponing a server upgrade entirely.  
Anyone paying for a plugin stack – If you currently run separate paid plugins for caching, CDN, image optimization, and a firewall, the addon frequently replaces several at once. Fewer plugins means a lighter site, fewer conflicts, less to update — and for many users, the cancelled subscriptions cover the $5 by themselves.

What Does It Mean for Agencies?

If you manage websites for clients, this addon is worth looking at as a product rather than a cost.

Consider the economics. Getting comparable protection directly from Cloudflare means Business-plan pricing of around $20 per domain — and remember, Cloudflare's plans bill per domain, so twenty client sites means twenty subscriptions. On xCloud, you get the Enterprise tier for $5 per domain, which leaves a healthy margin between what you pay and what you can reasonably charge.

Most agencies bill this to clients between $15 and $25 per domain as an "Enterprise CDN & Security" line item — a service clients understand immediately and can see working. On a portfolio of 20 client sites, that's $100 per month out and $400 per month in.

The workflow is built for it, too. The multi-site checkout lets you enable across your entire portfolio in one purchase, the team-wide domain table shows every protected client domain in one view, and when reporting day comes, the Analytics and Security tabs already contain the numbers your monthly client reports need. Faster client sites, fewer 3 a.m. emergencies, and recurring revenue on work you're barely touching.

How Much Does It Cost?

$5 per domain, per month. That's the entire pricing model.

For context, Cloudflare's own paid plans are also billed per domain: Pro at $20/month and Business at $200/month on annual billing (more on monthly billing), while Enterprise itself is sold through negotiated annual contracts that independent sources commonly report starting in the low thousands per month.

On xCloud, the same Enterprise tier is $5 per domain — every feature included, no tiers, no contract. Select multiple sites in one checkout and the total updates live as you pick: two domains show $10.00/month, ten show $50.00. Removing a domain stops its renewals immediately, and the rest continue untouched.

There's no free trial, and that's deliberate. Instead, we run two identical public demo sites — one with the addon enabled, one without — so you can point any speed testing tool at both and see the difference before spending anything.

How Do You Enable It?

Setup takes minutes, with no Cloudflare account and no nameserver migration:

Step 1: Enable the addon. Open Addons → Cloudflare Enterprise from the left navigation, or go straight to any site's own Cloudflare Enterprise page.

Step 2: Select your sites. Pick one or more sites in the purchase modal — the total updates live at $5 per domain as you select.

Step 3: Point your DNS. Click CNAME Records on your domain row and add the exact records shown at your DNS provider. Apex domains get guidance for @ and www, subdomains need a single record, and registrars that can't CNAME a root domain get fallback A-record instructions.

Our scheduled status checker then verifies your domain automatically and moves it to Active. Your Domains table always shows exactly where things stand:

Pending Verification – Cloudflare is waiting for your DNS records; add them and wait for the scheduled check, or click Refresh to verify instantly  
Active – DNS and SSL are live through Cloudflare Enterprise, and all features (including cache purge) are available  
Failed – something in the configuration needs attention; a Retry action lets you recover without removing and re-adding the domain

And if your DNS zone already runs through xCloud's Cloudflare integration, we create the records for you automatically and show an auto-managed banner instead. Setup becomes genuinely one click.

Two more details worth knowing: sites already subscribed are filtered out of the checkout automatically, so you can never double-purchase a domain — and removing a domain stops its future renewals immediately, with a reminder to point your DNS back to your server first so traffic keeps flowing.

Summary

Whether you run a single WordPress site, a WooCommerce store, or a portfolio of client websites, the Cloudflare Enterprise addon is built to be the right choice. Our partnership with Cloudflare and straightforward per-domain pricing have made an enterprise-tier network accessible to websites of every size.

And you can count on xCloud — no matter how big or small your business — to have access to the same class of infrastructure the largest companies on the internet rely on.

This drive to deliver real value, and to make enterprise-grade hosting as simple as possible for everyone, is what shapes everything we build. So activate the Cloudflare Enterprise addon, watch your own analytics tell the story, and keep an eye on what comes next — there's more on the way.
